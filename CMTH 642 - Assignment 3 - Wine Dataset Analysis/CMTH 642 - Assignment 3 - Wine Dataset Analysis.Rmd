Install packages required for the assignment
Downloading the dataset wine quality

```{r}
# install.packages("class")
# install.packages("gmodels")
library(class)
library(gmodels)
dataurl = "http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-white.csv"
wine = read.csv(dataurl, header = TRUE, sep = ";")
```

1. Check data characteristics. Is there missing data? 
```{r}
str(wine)
which(is.na(wine))

# There is no missing data.
```

2. What is the correlation between the attributes other than wine quality?
```{r}
winecor = cor(wine[-12])
winecor

# install.packages("corrplot")
library(corrplot)
corrplot.mixed(winecor, lower.col = 'black', number.cex = 0.75)
```

3.Graph the frequency distribution of wine quality.
```{r}
hist(wine$quality)
```

4. Reduce the levels of rating for quality to three levels as high, medium and low
```{r}
wine$quality = ifelse(wine$quality < 5, 'low', ifelse(wine$quality > 7, 'high', 'medium'))
wine$quality = ordered(wine$quality, c('low', 'medium', 'high'))
round(prop.table(table(wine$quality)) * 100, digits = 1)
```

5. Normalize the data set
```{r}
normalize = function(x) {return ((x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x)))}
wine2 = as.data.frame(sapply(wine[-12], normalize))
```

6. Divide the data to training and testing groups
```{r}
train_ind = sample(nrow(wine), floor(0.65 * nrow(wine)))
train = wine2[train_ind,]
test = wine2[-train_ind,]
train_labels = wine[train_ind, 12] 
test_labels = wine[-train_ind, 12]
```

7. Use the KNN algorithm to predict the quality of wine using its attributes.
```{r}
wine_prediction <- knn(train, test, train_labels, 5)
```

8. Evaluate the model performance
```{r}
table(train_labels)
CrossTable(x = test_labels, y = wine_prediction, prop.chisq = F)

# Calculating the accuracy from the output of the CrossTable function, I obtained a value of about 92% accuracy for this k-nearest neighbors model.
```
